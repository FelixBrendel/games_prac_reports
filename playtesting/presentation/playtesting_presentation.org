* COMMENT Recap qubi
- Puzzle game
- Different floor types (slippery, dry)
- Goal: figure out how to get to the finish

* UI
- necessary to communicate controls to the players
- but dont use written language

** Main menu
{{{insertVideo(controls1.mp4, , width="80%")}}}

** More conrols
{{{insertVideo(controls2.mp4, , width="80%")}}}

** How it works
- Second renderpass necessary
- use Dear ImGui to record draw calls
- Submit it to the GPU

** RenderDoc
- *Result*: minimal necessary shaders and draw calls generated

** Suggestions from the playtesters

- ....Achievments & Unlockable Skins

* Conclusion of the playtest
 - Look at all the negative experiences
 - Improve on them
 - üìà

** Finish tiles
- Make them clearer to distinguish
- Maybe use symbols instead of only colors

** Unfolding level
- Introduced 3 new machanics:
  - unfolding
  - multiple finishes
  - undo
- Just too much $\rightarrow$ split into multiple levels
{{{insertImage(3p1.png, , width: 40%)}}}

** Confusing Undo
{{{insertVideo(undo.mp4, , width="80%")}}}

** Undo Solutions
1. Introduce with written text what the button does
2. Show an overlay like ‚è™
3. Play the whole animation chain backwards
