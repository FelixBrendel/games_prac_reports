* Playtesting approach
** Qubi playtesting version
*** Main Menu
The main menu was created as an in-game level itself.
Therefore players move the cube on the tiles (slippery and dry) to reach a 
finish.
As of writing this report, the main menu consists of two finishes,
one tile that specifically starts the game with the first level and one tile
that quits the game. These tiles were specifically equipped with corresponding
textures.
The idea was to offer a way for players to experiment with the basic controls 
before they actually started playing the first level.

As can be observed in [[Fig:Menu]], this level can be extended with additional
menu functions such as an options menu or a way to continue a previous session.
*** Level structure
In this version of qubi that we used to playtesting we featured a total of twelve
different levels which we arranged in the following three sections:
The first three levels only featured slippery tiles, obstacle tiles and a finish.
We figured with the initial prompt of the movement instruction, this number of 
levels would be sufficient to convey a basic understanding for the core mechanics.
For the next six levels we added green dry tiles on which the cube would flip.
Finishes also require a specific side of the cube to be on top/bottom.
We did not add instructions here.
The focus of the remaining three levels was the unfolding mechanic. For that
we added one prompt to show which keys need to be pressed to unfold the cube.
Should the player make a mistake we further added a prompt to undo actions.\\

As a main philosophy we wanted to keep instructions at a minimum. We
believe that figuring these mechanics is part of the enjoyment of qubi.
The playtest would determine if the amount of instructions we featured are enough
or if they are too vague. In addition the representation of the different
tile types is tested as well. We want to see if players understand the different
tile types as they keep playing.

** Play Matrix
The following play matrix displays how the participants of our playtesting
session classified {{{insert_game_name_here}}}. As we expected
{{{insert_game_name_here}}} was placed across the the top left quadrant that is
representing skill and mental calculation. Most of the participants placed it
close to the top left corner next to chess and Go. This makes sense for us as
all moves in {{{insert_game_name_here}}} are deterministic so there is no chance
involved and it also matches the vision of the game we had set out to create.

** Questionnaire results
In the following question we will go over each question that we answered in our
questionnaire and go over the results that we gathered from our playtesting
group. For the test session of {{{insert_game_name_here}}} we gathered a group
of 16 playtestern. The majority of our playtesters had a very high experience
playing video games, although a small subset only had rudimentary knowledge of
gaming.
*** What is the objective of the game?
All of the participants were able to describe the objective in simple terms
leading us to believe that the goal was communicated intuitivly by the
differently colored tiles without the need for any additional input.
*** What were your first impressions of the game?
Most testers noted the minimalistic design first and for some it even created an
expectation of the type of game that was about to follow. For a few players it
even came as a suprise that the cube was able to slide on the ice tiles and they
expected a different kind of puzzle game.
*** Controls
The controls were considered to be intuitiv by the majority of our playtester
and were commended for being simple. This was probably due to a high number of
experienced gamer that are very used to WASD based movement. Even though the
controls were intuitive a few of the participants suggested to also implement
control of the cube by using the arrow keys as it is fitting for these types of
games.
*** Were the Instructions clear enough?
The instructions was one of the most critiqued elements during the playtest.
About half of the testers thought that the instructions what the exact end goal
is for each level were not communicated well enough. Additionally to this group
some thought that the instructions for the mechanics were understandable but
that the visual clarity of the finish tiles could be improved. There also was a
smaller subset of our playtesters that enjoyed the explorative aspect of
learning the game mechanics with a minimum of instructions provided. They mostly
argued that figuring out what the goal was for a new level felt to them as part
of the game and induced an intrinsic reward for finishing each level.
*** How would rate the difficulty of the puzzles?
The difficulty of the puzzles was judged to be good by the majority of the
playtesters. The slight increase in difficulty was also noticed and was
perceived as suitable. Most of the players considered the level introducing the
unfolding mechanic, undo button and two finish tiles as the most difficult but
argued that it was mainly due to lack of instruction. The difficulty for them
was realizing how the new mechanics work exactly which was also observed as they
managed to solve the following unfold level much quicker.
*** Different type of players
In terms of playing style three different types of players were observed:
1) Players that used trial and error right from the start, which was decently
   effective as the number of possible moves and level size/complexity is not at
   the stage that we have envisioned
2) Strategic players that were observing the complete level first and already
   planning out a route. Some of these type of players suffered from an analysis
   paralysis in the levels that introduced new mechanics such as the unfolding
   and two finish tiles. The prompt for the unfolding of the cube was only shown
   after moving the cube to a tile on which it could be unfolded. Players who
   wanted to plan out their moves beforehand did not reach the tile for the
   instruction and thus thought the level to be impossible to solve.
3) The third type of player that we observed were a mix between the trial and
   error and strategic. These players first tried to navigate the cube through
   the level until there was an obstacle presented to them that they could not
   solve directly. After that they switched to an analytical/strategic mode and
   solved the levels in that manner.

Interestingly none of the player types had a significant advantage in how fast
they solved all of the playtest levels.
*** In which situation would you play the game?
Many of the playtesters argued that {{{insert_game_name_here}}} is perfect as a
quick puzzle game while traveling long and short distances because the
atmosphere is calming and the concept is simple. They also mentioned for this
reason that porting {{{insert_game_name_here}}} to a mobile platform would
greatly benefit the game.
*** What was the best aspect of the game for you?
The aspect that was considered the best for many of the testers was the unfold
mechanic of the cube. Many argued that this gameplay element added a signifcant
amount of creative depth to the already interesting puzzles and was something
that they had not seen in any other games. Other parts of the game that were
positively received was the fact that it was a spatial puzzle game, something
that is not very common to see even for experienced gamers. Some players also
mentioned that it was very fun to learn about the game and its mechanics was
intrinsicly fun for them.
*** What was the worst aspect of the game for you?
Most of the testers considered the lack of clear direction and instruction the
worst aspect of the game, especially in the level that introduced three new
mechanics.
*** How fitting was the music in your opinion?
The music was rated generally well by the majority of participants although it
was argued to be too loud. Some players also mentioned that the general style of
music captured the cozy feeling very well and that it increased their focus on
the puzzles while the music shifted to the background. On the other hand it was
also mentioned by a few tester that the main music loop was becoming a little
bit too repetetive after around 20 min - 30 min of play time.
*** How would you rate the visuals of the game?
Good
*** What would you change about the game and do you have any other suggestions?
For this question we wanted some free feedback and suggestions from the
playtesters. The suggestions were relativly similar and we have compiled them
into the following list:
- Add more mechanics that also incorporate the 3rd dimension or intermediary finishe tiles
- Increase the number of levels and the complexity/length of the levels
- Including achievments for finishing certain levels or finishing them with a
  limited amount of moves.
- Unlockable map skins
- A limit of how many moves are needed per level including a counter to make it
  feel more like a puzzle game
- Particle effects when moving the cube
- Better visual clarity for the finish tiles
- Embedding a demo video of the game in the main menu/pause screen to motivate
  player
*** Notes
We also compiled some notes that we took during the observation of our
playtesters into the following list:
- Some people tried to use the mouse in the main menu to "click start game"
- Undo button was used by some players as a restart button and the purpose was
  generally not 100% clear
- Some were afraid to let the cube fall of the unbounded side of the level
- Unfold was by some only used to turn cube which made some levels trivial
- It was not understood intuitivly why they could not unfold on ice, and only
  realized after trial and error
- Color change due to misplaced light confused a player to misjudged the color
  need for the finish tile
- The need to keept he space bar pressed while unfolding was not communicated directly enough and not intuitive for the majority of the testers
* Conclusion of the playtest - felix
- Extra level before the first unfold to introduce mechanic in a simpler setting
- dont introduce unfold, two finish and undo key in one level, introduce them one mechanic per level
- Improve visual clarity of the finish tiles
- Better communicate that player used Undo action, one would be playing the last animation backwards
- Better textures
