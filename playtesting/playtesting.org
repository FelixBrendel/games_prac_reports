* Playtesting approach
** Qubi playtesting version
*** Main Menu
The main menu was created as an in-game level itself.
Therefore players move the cube on the tiles (slippery and dry) to reach a 
finish.
As of writing this report, the main menu consists of two finishes,
one tile that specifically starts the game with the first level and one tile
that quits the game. These tiles were specifically equipped with corresponding
textures.
The idea was to offer a way for players to experiment with the basic controls 
before they actually started playing the first level.

As can be observed in [[Fig:Menu]], this level can be extended with additional
menu functions such as an options menu or a way to continue a previous session.
*** Level structure
In this version of qubi that we used to playtesting we featured a total of twelve
different levels which we arranged in the following three sections:
The first three levels only featured slippery tiles, obstacle tiles and a finish.
We figured with the initial prompt of the movement instruction, this number of 
levels would be sufficient to convey a basic understanding for the core mechanics.
For the next six levels we added green dry tiles on which the cube would flip.
Finishes also require a specific side of the cube to be on top/bottom.
We did not add instructions here.
The focus of the remaining three levels was the unfolding mechanic. For that
we added one prompt to show which keys need to be pressed to unfold the cube.
Should the player make a mistake we further added a prompt to undo actions.\\

As a main philosophy we wanted to keep instructions at a minimum. We
believe that figuring these mechanics is part of the enjoyment of qubi.
The playtest would determine if the amount of instructions we featured are enough
or if they are too vague. In addition the representation of the different
tile types is tested as well. We want to see if players understand the different
tile types as they keep playing.
