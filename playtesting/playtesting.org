* Playtesting approach
** Qubi playtesting version

To prepare the game to get into a shape where it can be played by our
playtesters, it was time to make some changes to introduce new players to the
game and improve the general usability of it. We did not have any kind of user
interface or way of telling the player how to play the game, which we addressed
in this first step of the playtesting phase.

*** Changes to the renderer
For the playtesting we did not want to interfer with the tester while they are
playing. But since the game introduces mechanics on the fly that require the
player to learn new keybindings, we wanted to implement image overlays that fade
in to visually show the player images of the keys they need to press to discover
new game mechanics.

As a start we looked at [[https://github.com/ocornut/imgui][Dear ImGui]] to render any kind of user interface. It is
an implementation of an immidiate mode graphical user interface. It outputs
drawcalls to draw the requested UI. To use it, we created a second rendering
pipeline and render pass for the UI and every frame let ImGui record the draw
calls into command buffers to draw the UI.

When doing this we observed a performance penalty of around 20% for the second
render pass (from around 11.000 fps to around 9.000 fps on our machines). We
also experimented with instead rendering the UI in a second subpass in the main
render pass, and marking the main render pass as a subpass dependency for the UI
subpass. We could not however not any performance improvement and reverted the
changes, as rendering two separate render passes led to simpler code.

We also used RenderDoc to take a look at the shaders and draw calls that ImGui
generated for our simple image overlay. We noticed that ImGui only generates the
shaders and draw calls that are needed to render the requested UI, so the shader
only consisted of sampling the image. We decided, that was enough and left it
like that. Because even if we decided to render the overlay completely
ourselves, we would probably not see any performance benefit over using ImGui.

*** Main Menu
The main menu was created as an in-game level itself. Therefore players move the
cube on the tiles (slippery and dry) to reach a finish. As of writing this
report, the main menu consists of two finishes, one tile that specifically
starts the game with the first level and one tile that quits the game. These
tiles were specifically equipped with corresponding textures. The idea was to
offer a way for players to experiment with the basic controls before they
actually started playing the first level.

As can be observed in [[Fig:Menu]], this level can be extended with additional menu
functions such as an options menu or a way to continue a previous session.

*** Level structure
In this version of qubi that we used to playtesting we featured a total of twelve
different levels which we arranged in the following three sections:
The first three levels only featured slippery tiles, obstacle tiles and a finish.
We figured with the initial prompt of the movement instruction, this number of 
levels would be sufficient to convey a basic understanding for the core mechanics.
For the next six levels we added green dry tiles on which the cube would flip.
Finishes also require a specific side of the cube to be on top/bottom.
We did not add instructions here.
The focus of the remaining three levels was the unfolding mechanic. For that
we added one prompt to show which keys need to be pressed to unfold the cube.
Should the player make a mistake we further added a prompt to undo actions.
We expected players to have the hardest time with these levels but also the
most enjoyable time with all the different options.\\

# Minh to Felix: weiß nicht, dass könntest du auch zu UI hinkopieren
As a main philosophy we wanted to keep instructions at a minimum. We
believe that figuring out these mechanics is part of the enjoyment of qubi.
The playtest would determine if the amount of instructions we featured are enough
or if they are too vague. In addition the representation of the different
tile types is tested as well. We want to see if players understand the meanings 
of the different tile types as they play.
** Procedure
After welcoming the testers we made sure to remind them that we were testing
the game, not their skill. We also requested for the testers to speak out loud 
when playing qubi while we remained quiet.
All of the 12 levels are rather short. This is why we let the testers play 
through all 12 levels until they finished without interrupting them.
As the testers were playing the game, we made sure to note our observations
regarding their understanding/confusion of the game mechanics. 
These observations helped us get more insight into possible target audiences.
With the completion of the last level, we then discussed aspects of qubi with
the testers in one on one conversations. 
** Questions
Starting off we asked testers for their first impression of qubi as well as 
how much that first impression changed.
To get a better understanding of the testers' knowledge of qubi,
we further asked them to describe the objective of the game as well as the 
gameplay mechanics. 
Following that were technical questions as to how testers felt about the 
controls and the minimalistic instructions that were featured.
We then had them locate qubi on the play matrix and asked them if and where 
they would move the game.

Afterwards testers told us about their view on the positive and negative aspects
of qubi including their take on the music choice. 
Finally they made suggestions regarding changes and/or additions to the game.

- meisten intuitiv bis 50/50
- manche wollten lieber pfeiltasten
*** Instructions clear enough
- Den meisten waren die Anweisungen zu wenig
- manche fandens ok
- Visual clarity der Finish tiles ist zu gering

- flipping was understood quickly
- undo was only understood by one person directly
- multiple finish tiles was understood 50/50
- Unfold was mostly used to turn cube which made some levels trivial

2 finish tiles level:
- some people were faster to understand the unfold
- Analysis paralysis because they dont understand what they had to do




* Conclusion of the playtest
Even though all of the participants could identify the objective of the game
correctly, it was very often the case, that the testers could not distinguish
between different kinds of finishes. This includes both the difference between
slippery and dry tiles, as well as the difference between differently colored
finishes, where the cube has to has a certain orientation for the finish to
activate. For the final release we will work on making the different finishes
easier to distinguish. We are also thinking about using not colors but different
sybols to distinguish between the different types of finishes, and also make it
really clear to which side of the cube they correspond.

The reason why we think most peoples struggled with the unfolding level -- even
though the solution only consists of few moves -- is that we introduce too many
aspects in this single level. They include the unfolding, the presence of
multiple finish tiles whose win conditions all have to be satisfied at once and
thirdly the undo funcionality that can be necessary in this level, as the
players can reach a state where they cannont finish the level anymore. To
mitigate the difficutly we will introduce these mechanics in separate levels, so
not all concepts have to be aquired in one single level, which we believe
overwhelmed the testers.

Also we noticed that many players did not understand the undo functionallity as
we only showed the keybind and no written instructions. Until now we just
teleport the players back to the position they where before. It seems however,
some players did not understand this intuitively and we believe this is because
there is no visual feedback for the player to notice that we are setting their
position to the previous one. There are some options we believe we have here.

1. When introducing the player to the keybind for the undo, we could also add a
   text next to the keybind that describes what it does. This violates our
   philosophy to not communicate with the players with language, but might be
   the easiest way to solve this problem.
2. Another way could be, showing the player what is happening during an undo
   action with the help of an image overlay. For example we could whow a symbol
   \RewindToIndex for a short amount of time when the player pressed the undo
   button.
3. Finally, the best results would probably be archieved when the movement
   animation would be played backwards to the position the cube was before.
   While we believe this would lead to the most intuitive learning of the undo
   functionallity, it is also the technically most challenging version to
   implement, as a single move can consist of many animations which itself
   consist of parenting, movement and unparenting actions, which would all need
   to played backwards in reverse order.
