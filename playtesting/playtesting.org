* Playtesting approach
** Qubi playtesting version
*** Main Menu
The main menu was created as an in-game level itself.
Therefore players move the cube on the tiles (slippery and dry) to reach a 
finish.
As of writing this report, the main menu consists of two finishes,
one tile that specifically starts the game with the first level and one tile
that quits the game. These tiles were specifically equipped with corresponding
textures.
The idea was to offer a way for players to experiment with the basic controls 
before they actually started playing the first level.

As it can be observed in [[Fig:Menu]], this level can be extended with additional
menu functions such as an options menu or a way to continue a previous session.
*** Featured Levels
In this version of qubi that we used to playtesting we featured a total of twelve
different levels which we arranged in the following three sections:
The first three levels only featured slippery tiles, obstacle tiles and a finish.
We figured with the initial prompt of the movement instruction, this number of 
levels would be sufficient to convey a basic understanding for the core mechanics.
For the next six levels we added green dry tiles on which the cube would flip.
Finishes also require a specific side of the cube to be on top/bottom.
We did not add instructions here.
The focus of the remaining three levels was the unfolding mechanic. For that
we added one prompt to show which keys need to be pressed to unfold the cube.
Should the player make a mistake we further added a prompt to undo actions.
We expected players to have the hardest time with these levels but also the
most enjoyable time with all the different options.\\

As a main philosophy we wanted to keep instructions at a minimum. We
believe that figuring out these mechanics is part of the enjoyment of qubi.
The playtest would determine if the amount of instructions we featured are enough
or if they are too vague. In addition the representation of the different
tile types is tested as well. We want to see if players understand the meanings 
of the different tile types as they play.
** Procedure
After welcoming the testers we made sure to remind them that we were testing
the game, not their skill. We also requested for the testers to speak out loud 
when playing qubi while we remained quiet.
All of the 12 levels are rather short. This is why we let the testers play 
through all 12 levels until they finished without interrupting them.
As the testers were playing the game, we made sure to note our observations
regarding their understanding/confusion of the game mechanics. 
These observations helped us get more insight into possible target audiences.
With the completion of the last level, we then discussed aspects of qubi with
the testers in one on one conversations. 
** Questions
Starting off we asked testers for their first impression of qubi as well as 
how much that first impression changed.
To get a better understanding of the testers' knowledge of qubi,
we further asked them to describe the objective of the game as well as the 
gameplay mechanics. 
Following that were technical questions as to how testers felt about the 
controls and the minimalistic instructions that were featured.
We then had them locate qubi on the play matrix and asked them if and where 
they would move the game.

Afterwards testers told us about their view on the positive and negative aspects
of qubi including their take on the music choice. 
Finally they made suggestions regarding changes and/or additions to the game. 
* Playtesting results
** Play Matrix - jonas
** Questionnaire - jonas
*** Instructions & Objective of the game
- All of the participants described the objective consistently
*** First impression
- Minimalistic,
*** Controls
- meisten intuitiv bis 50/50
- manche wollten lieber pfeiltasten
*** Instructions clear enough
- Den meisten waren die Anweisungen zu wenig
- manche fandens ok
- Visual clarity der Finish tiles ist zu gering
*** Different type of players
- Some players used trial and error from beginning
- Some players had a strategic approach
- Time to solve all levels was not affected by the player type
*** In which situation would you play the game
- During travels/wait times
- Good puzzle game for mobile platfroms
- Good
*** Best aspect
- Unfold mechanic is really cool and creative
- Spatial puzzles are rare pepes and therefore good
- Learning about the game mechanics was fun
*** Worst aspect
- Frustrating to figure out what the goal is
- Frustrating because spatial puzzles are hard

- Some did understand that you had to reach both goals at the same time
- Some persons(2) did not find anything frustrating
- Felix parents: instructions not clear
-
*** Suggestions & what would you change
- More mechanics also in 3rd dimensions, mid finishes, activator tiles
- Achievment medals for finishing certain levels/thresholds
- Max Step counter

- More help and instructions
- Demo video would motivate player
- Show what the goal is in a level
- more levels
- Instruction for undo was not well understood
- Better visual feedback for dry tiles that show that the cube will flip
- Music too monotone after a certain time

- better textures for more visual clarity
- more complex and longer levels also in 3rd dimension
- unlockable skins
- Fx for sliding the cube
- Erst super einfaches mini level um mechanic zu introduced
*** Music
- cozy and working in the background
- not distracting
- too repetetive
Erst: wieso slidet man

*** Notes - jonas
- People tried to use mouse to click start game
- Visual clarity not good
- Undo button as restart button
- When have intitial struggles with the level they default to trial and error
- Some people were afraid to fall of the unbounded side of the level

- sliding was understood quickly
- brown is obstacles was understood quickly
- flipping was understood quickly
- undo was only understood by one person directly
- multiple finish tiles was understood 50/50
- Unfold was mostly used to turn cube which made some levels trivial
- some ppl didnt understand why they could not unfold on ice, realized after trial and error

- One person didnt understand animation lock instantly
- Some were not able to distinguish whether finish tile is dry or not
- Use of the space bar unfold not instantly understood
- Color change due to misplaced light confused a player (misjudged the color)
- Use of undo button was not 100% clear

2 finish tiles level:
- some people were faster to understand the unfold
- Analysis paralysis because they dont understand what they had to do

* Conclusion of the playtest - felix
- Extra level before the first unfold to introduce mechanic in a simpler setting
- dont introduce unfold, two finish and undo key in one level, introduce them one mechanic per level
- Improve visual clarity of the finish tiles
- Better communicate that player used Undo action, one would be playing the last animation backwards
- Better textures
