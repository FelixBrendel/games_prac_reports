* Final Version of qubi
Since the conclusion of the playtests we have added a plethora of aspects to 
qubi.
In the following we will cover the additions in regards to technical aspects and
content.
** Technical Aspects
# keeping it short i guess
# MSAA, images?
During development we noticed aliasing artifacts at the edges of tiles. To 
counteract these we implemented multisample anti-aliasing. The number of samples
that would be used per pixel was determined by picking the highest sample
count that is supported by the used graphics card.
# Mipmapping, images?
Additionally to deal with artifacts in textures, especially for written text, 
we implemented mipmapping. The number of levels in the mip chain for each 
texture was calculated using its resolution.
# Shadow Mapping
# ASSets
# shaders
# sound effects etc.
** Content
# gameplay mechanics were already done before but added arrow keys
In qubi players have to maneuver a cube through tile-based levels filled with 
obstacles to reach the finish. On slippery tiles the cube will slide until it 
encounters a wall, obstacle or dry tile on which the cube would flip.
In certain levels finishes require a specific side of the cube to land on 
prompting the player to use the dry tiles to reorient the cube. 
In later levels the cube can be unfolded on dry tiles. As a result finish tiles 
can be reached now which otherwise would be impossible to get to.
Furthermore levels can also feature multiple finish tiles on which the cube has 
to land on a specific side by using the unfold mechanic.
As it was a common suggestion during playtests, we have added the arrow keys for 
controlling the movement of the cube (apart from the WASD keys).
# 21 levels + 1 menu, structure, hopefully better introductions
In total qubi consists of 21 levels for players to traverse through. 
Initial levels only consist of slippery and obstacle tiles. Later on dry tiles 
are added as well as finish tiles requiring a specific cube side. In the final
portion of the game we introduce the unfold mechanic along with the option to 
undo an action. 
For the playtests we introduced both these mechanics in the same level. This was
also the level that our testers struggled with the most.
Because of this we added more introductory levels for these gameplay mechanics.\\
Additionally we added a menu level in which players maneuver the cube to finish
tiles that start a brand new game, continue or quit the game. This menu level
can also be accessed by pressing the escape key.
* Experience During The Class
# How well did your initial design ideas materialize into the final game?
# how did we meet the project plan and milestones? deviation from dev schedule
# how did project structure influence progress?

* Verdict
# impression of working with the theme (too restrictive?)
# biggest technical difficulty
# greatest success
# are we satisfied with the result? pros & cons
# expectations met? regrets.
# improvements for course organization
