* Final Version of qubi
Since the conclusion of the playtests we have added a plethora of aspects to 
qubi.
In the following we will cover the additions in regards to technical aspects and
content.
** Technical Aspects
# keeping it short i guess
# MSAA, images?
During development we noticed aliasing artifacts at the edges of tiles. To 
counteract these we implemented multisample anti-aliasing. The number of samples
that would be used per pixel was determined by picking the highest sample
count that is supported by the used graphics card.
# Mipmapping, images?
Additionally to deal with artifacts in textures, especially for written text, 
we implemented mipmapping. The number of levels in the mip chain for each 
texture was calculated using its resolution.
# Shadow Mapping
# ASSets, blender greatness
# shaders
# sound effects etc.
** Content
# gameplay mechanics were already done before but added arrow keys
In qubi players have to maneuver a cube through tile-based levels filled with 
obstacles to reach the finish. On slippery tiles the cube will slide until it 
encounters a wall, obstacle or dry tile on which the cube would flip.
In certain levels finishes require a specific side of the cube to land on 
prompting the player to use the dry tiles to reorient the cube. 
In later levels the cube can be unfolded on dry tiles. As a result finish tiles 
can be reached now which otherwise would be impossible to get to.
Furthermore levels can also feature multiple finish tiles on which the cube has 
to land on a specific side by using the unfold mechanic.
As it was a common suggestion during playtests, we have added the arrow keys for 
controlling the movement of the cube (apart from the WASD keys).
# 21 levels + 1 menu, structure, hopefully better introductions
In total qubi consists of 21 levels for players to traverse through. 
Initial levels only consist of slippery and obstacle tiles. Later on dry tiles 
are added as well as finish tiles requiring a specific cube side. In the final
portion of the game we introduce the unfold mechanic along with the option to 
undo an action. 
For the playtests we introduced both these mechanics in the same level. This was
also the level that our testers struggled with the most.
Because of this we added more introductory levels for these gameplay mechanics.\\
Additionally we added a menu level in which players maneuver the cube to finish
tiles that start a brand new game, continue or quit the game. This menu level
can also be accessed by pressing the escape key.
# TODO: images
* Experience During The Class
# How well did your initial design ideas materialize into the final game?
qubi was designed to be a cozy puzzle game that could be enjoyed every now and 
then. We wanted the game to show the fundamental instructions but still 
require players to experiment with the game to fully understand the mechanics. 
All in all we believe that we did a decent job with this game.
The three gameplay mechanics themselves are simple. The instructions are enough
to give players a spark to get started but not reveal everything about the 
game's mechanics.
The levels ramp up in difficulty as the three mechanics are progressively added.
And finally the music and sound effects are satisfying and calming.
# how did we meet the project plan and milestones? deviation from dev schedule
# how did project structure influence progress?

* Personal Impressions
# impression of working with the theme (too restrictive?)
The theme "wet & slippery" at first seemed a little daunting to us.
However the idea of a cube sliding on ice already seemed fulfill the theme.
We were then able to be more creative with working out more mechanics.
As a result the theme was not as restrictive as we initially thought.
# biggest technical difficulty
The biggest technical difficulty would be building our engine while developing
the game. We had to implement features for game development that would be 
taken for granted in an existing engine. 
Thanks to the simplicity of our game we were able to juggle both the development 
of our engine and game. As the engine was made specifically for qubi, we were 
able to leave out features that were not needed (e.g. a graphics engine).
# greatest success
# are we satisfied with the result? pros & cons
# expectations met? regrets.
# improvements for course organization
In regards to the course organization we feel that how the milestones and their 
deadlines were handled were a little confusing. We feel that the project 
structure document in the course materials for one should be updated again as
at some points it seems to contradict itself. The deadlines for the milestones 
could further be communicated better.
