* Prototype Description
For the phyiscal prototype of the second milestone we decided to use paper,
domino tiles and wooden cubes. The dominoes were used as the map barrier while
the wooden cubes performed the task of the collideable objects in the level as
shown in Figure [[Fig:PProtoLv1]]. We first used a six sided die as the player
controlled cube to test in our sample level Figure [[Fig:Level1]].

Furthermore we created a foldable prototype from paper to test the third major
game mechanic. Due to the physical limitations the cube can obviously not freely
unfold and only use the pre-determined cuts.


* Observations
** Cube has to move into the folding direction while folding out to keep possibilities open
** cringe
** chess prototype was shit
