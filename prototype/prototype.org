* Prototype Description
For the phyiscal prototype of the second milestone we decided to use paper,
domino tiles and wooden cubes. 
We first used a six sided Pokemon-themed die as 
the player-controlled cube to test in our sample level Figure.
The dominoes were used as the map barrier while
the wooden cubes performed the task of the collideable objects in the level as
shown in Figure [[Fig:PProtoLv1]]. We first used a six sided die as the player
controlled cube to test our sample level Figure [[Fig:Level1]].

In order to test out dry tiles a second prototype was created which was supposed 
to resemble the second sample level.
For the representation of these dry tiles we used colored strips of paper as 
can be observed in the following.

Furthermore we created a foldable prototype from paper to test the third major
game mechanic, the unfolding of the cube, in a rudimentary test level. Due to
the physical limitations the cube can obviously not freely unfold and only use
the pre-determined cuts.

* Observations & Revisions
During the creation of the physical we realized several attributes, problems and
design possibilities that we did not think about before. In the following
sections we will highlight the most significant new perspectives that we gained
in the prototyping process.
# ** Chess prototype
#+begin_comment
For our first attempt in prototype creation we used chess pieces to build the
level (Figure [[Fig:PProtoChess]]). The main issues with this iteration of our
prototype was that the chess pieces did not mark the tiles as distinctly as we
wanted to. Therefore we opted to use rectangular building blocks for the
prototype levels.

** Transition from slippery to dry tile
Testing the prototype for the second sample level ([[Fig:PProtoLv2]])brought up the 
question of how the cube should behave when moving from a slippery surface onto
a dry one and vice versa.
Both possibilities of a sliding transition and a flipping motion seemed 
equally plausible as both options influence the task of designing levels roughly
the same.
That being said, we made the decision to have the cube consistently flip by 90 
degrees when transitioning between slippery and dry tiles. This seemed
like the more "realistic" option to us.

** Number of differentiable cube surfaces
With the concept of dry tiles on which the cube would move by flipping by 90 degrees
, we introduced new finish tiles. In order to complete such levels the cube
would have to land on these finish tiles in a speciic orientation. \\   
An further observation that was made in the second prototype ([[Fig:PProtoLv2]]) was that
this initial concept would cause levels to become too complex if all six surfaces of the 
cube mattered. 
As a result we made the change reduce the number of all differentiable surfaces down to three.
We feel it reduces the complexity down to a more reasonable level.
** State of finish tiles
# Minh: sooo, variable then?
When testing our prototype one of the first things that we realized was that there
is a significant difference whether the finish tile is slippery or dry. We see
this aspect as a new angle in the level design as we can create levels that seem
simple on the first glance but are more complex as the direct route would let
the cube slide beyond the finish tile. This type of level design is especially
suited for the first tier where the only mechanic available are the sliding
tiles.
** Unfold direction of the cube
The player is supposed unfold the cube in order to reach a tile they
would otherwise slide over or not reach in the first place. 
In the initial attempt of the sample level ([[Fig:PProtoLv3]]) in which we tried the 
unfolding mechanic, we made the mistake of having the remainders of the
partially unfolded cube stick the starting tile instead of moving forward.
Having made this mistake it made us further consider whether the player should be
able to unfold the cube anywhere as long as they are standing still or the cube can
only be unfolded on dry tiles. \\
# What's our call here? Maybe add additional indicators?

** Game Speed & Animation Locking
While watching our footage we noticed that the animation/game speed was far to
slow. The movement of the cube has to feel responsive while at the same time
consider the animation locking that we want to implement due to gameplay
reasons. We believe that one effective way to balance these aspects is to
implement input buffering, which allows the user to input a new command while
the cube is still animation locked. This new command will then be executed as
soon as the last animation has finished.
