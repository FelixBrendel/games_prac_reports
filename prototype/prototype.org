* Prototype Description
For the phyiscal prototype of the second milestone we decided to use paper,
domino tiles and wooden cubes. The dominoes were used as the map barrier while
the wooden cubes performed the task of the collideable objects in the level as
shown in Figure [[Fig:PProtoLv1]]. We first used a six sided die as the player
controlled cube to test in our sample level Figure [[Fig:Level1]].

Furthermore we created a foldable prototype from paper to test the third major
game mechanic, the unfolding of the cube, in a rudementary test level. Due to
the physical limitations the cube can obviously not freely unfold and only use
the pre-determined cuts.

* Observations & Revisions
During the creation of the physical we realized several attributes, problems and
design possibilities that we did not think about before. In the following
sections we will highlight the most significant new perspectives that we gained
in the prototyping process.
** Chess prototype
For our first attempt in prototype creation we used chess pieces to build the
level (Figure [[PProtoChess]]). The main issues with this iteration of our prototype
was that the chess pieces did not mark the tiles as distinctly as we wanted to.
Therefore we opted to use rectangular building blocks for the prototype levels.

** End Tiles dry or slippery
When testing our prototype one of the first things that we realized was that it
is a significant difference whether the finish tile is slippery or dry. We see
this aspect as a new angle in the level design as we can create levels that seem
simple on the first glance but are more complex as the direct route would let
the cube slide beyond the finish tile. This type of level design is especially
suited for the first tier where the only mechanic available are the sliding
tiles.
** Cube has to move into the folding direction while folding out(to keep possibilities open)
** Game Speed & Animation Locking
While watching our footage we notice that the animation/game speed was far to
slow. The movement of the cube has to feel responsive while at the same time
considering the animation locking that we want to implement due to gameplay
reasons. We believe that one effective way to balance these aspects is to
implement input buffering, which allows the user to input a new command while
the cube is still animation locked. This new command will then be executed as
soon as the last animation has finished.
