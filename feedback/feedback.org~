*** Things I like
I like the idea of the water tank adding more complexity to the very well
known kart racer genre. I can imagine new players liking the randomness of 
kart racers while practiced players enjoy the additional depth of resource
management.
*** Things I am unsure about
On the other hand an additional mechanic can also be an additional source of 
frustration, e.g. missing puddles and therefore not having enough resources
to start a comeback with an item.
Furthermore I can see people being a little overwhelmed by the water tank as
it may be very different to what they are used to.
