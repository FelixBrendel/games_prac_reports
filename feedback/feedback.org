*** Things I like
- Really well thought out water tank mechanic that allows players in the back to
  catch up due to puddles.
- The focus on the duality of power up items so that they can be used offensivly
  and defensivly is a great concept that fits well with the concept.
*** Things I am unsure about
-
- The two aspects of the water spots: Filling up the water tank and decreasing
  vehicle control might be unintuitive (not from a logical but a gameplay
  experience) and could lead to either comepletly avoiding the puddles or
  collecting all of them if the two aspects are not balanced well enough.

*** Things I like
- Cool game setting and flavor.
*** Things I am unsure about
- In an endless runner game the number of different game mechanics and
  interactables has to be high in order of not being too repetetive.
- Will the increasing difficulty be implemented by increasing the speed of the duck or by making the building blocks more difficult? According to the Design Document the building blocks are predetermined and can therefore not get more difficult if I understand correctly.
*** Suggestions
- Maybe also try to set course randomly by letting it follow a BÃ©zier-Curve
  through random points. The difficulty can then be increased by increasing the
  curvature.

*** Things I like
- Really cool setting and theme.
- The ice golems are really cute.
- Number of map events seem appropriate and the mechanics look very fun.
- All aspects of the game, from the mechanics, game world and character design
  mesh very well together.
*** Things I am unsure about
- Will the single screen for all users affect the map size or character clarity
  in a negative way? (Because all players have to fit on the screen and there
  still needs to be enough space for the events, fighting, ect.)
*** Suggestions
- Implement split-screen functionality or online mode if the single screen
  inhibits gameplay due to map size.
