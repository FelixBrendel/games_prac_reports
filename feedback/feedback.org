* Aquario Kart: Double Splash!!

** Felix

*** Things I like
- It will be a fun game because people are used to the feeling and mechanics
  from other games
- I am curious how well the AI will perform, it sounds really ambitious but at
  the same time really interesting. It will be interesting to see how much the
  AI plans their movement ahead vs how fast they can react to a changing
  environment.

*** Things I am unsure about
- I hope Aquario Kart can introduce some mechanics to make it stand out from
  other kart racers
- It might be hard to find satisfying steering mechanics

*** Suggestions
- Maybe to stand out from other "party-games" -- personally -- I would like to
  see more focus being put on a more balanced game. The thing -- again
  personally -- I don't like about party games, is that the best player can
  still lose while the worst can still win.

- It might be interesting to see the AI take specific actions to reach specific
  simple goals in the game. This is probably a lot harder that I think of it
  right now, but for example if the AI wants the player to be at a certain
  position relative to the player, it would be fun to see it trying to influence
  the players steering based on its goals. (Maybe this is much harder that I
  think, or maybe it is so obvious that you already thought about it :)

*** Things I like
- Really well thought out water tank mechanic that allows players in the back to
  catch up due to puddles.
- The focus on the duality of power up items so that they can be used offensivly
  and defensivly is a great concept that fits well with the concept.
*** Things I am unsure about
-
- The two aspects of the water spots: Filling up the water tank and decreasing
  vehicle control might be unintuitive (not from a logical but a gameplay
  experience) and could lead to either comepletly avoiding the puddles or
  collecting all of them if the two aspects are not balanced well enough.

*** Things I like
I like the idea of the water tank adding more complexity to the very well
known kart racer genre. I can imagine new players liking the randomness of 
kart racers while practiced players enjoy the additional depth of resource
management.
*** Things I am unsure about
On the other hand an additional mechanic can also be an additional source of 
frustration, e.g. missing puddles and therefore not having enough resources
to start a comeback with an item. \\
Furthermore I can see people being a little overwhelmed by the water tank as
it may be very different to what they are used to in a kart racer.

# i dont like this, gonna change it tomorrow
Kart racers to me are usually in a grey area between serious and competitive games 
and mindless fun spectacle. Depending on the direction of your game it may be 
a better idea to either focus on gameplay balance or make the game feel and 
look cool.

*** Things I like
- I like the idea of procedurally generating an endless track
- Really creative idea to have a bathroom themed game about a rubber duck
- The replay feature is super cool

*** Things I am unsure about
- Maybe it can be challenging to build diverse levels with procedural
  generation
- It might be hard to find satisfying steering mechanics
- It might be hard to make it feel natural (from a game design perspective) to
  shoot water. If the goal is to go as far as possible, is it then not best to
  go slow and safely?

*** Suggestions
- You probably already thought about the replay feature. But just from my quick
  brainstorm, I think you would at least need to store the world-seed and the
  user inputs to recreate the level and players movements. However absolute
  timestamps will not suffice as they will be imprecise and over time errors
  will add up. So you would need to either fix the framerate of the game and
  record the inputs relative to the advanced frames or maybe at least only
  process the inputs in fixed time steps but let the game render in a hiher
  framerate.

  The reason I was thinking about recording the inputs was, because I thought,
  it might be easier than to record the position and orientation of the
  character.

  A possible -- and maybe more robust -- middle way would be to record the
  position and orientation of the character at fixes time steps (maybe every 3
  seconds) and between that try to figure out the intermediate positions based
  on the recorded inputs. Like that, the replayfiles should not grow too big,
  and it should also not be possible for errors to spiral out.

  A relevant talk that comes to mind is:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dinUbg2h70 The presenter also had the problem
  to store and replay movements of a character, to be even able to rewind back
  in time and continue playing from there. If my memory served me right, he also
  opted for an approach where the stored the complete game state in fixed
  intervalls and inbetween tried his best to approximate it.

*** Things I like
- Cool game setting and flavor.
*** Things I am unsure about
- In an endless runner game the number of different game mechanics and
  interactables has to be high in order of not being too repetetive.
- Will the increasing difficulty be implemented by increasing the speed of the duck or by making the building blocks more difficult? According to the Design Document the building blocks are predetermined and can therefore not get more difficult if I understand correctly.
*** Suggestions
- Maybe also try to set course randomly by letting it follow a BÃ©zier-Curve
  through random points. The difficulty can then be increased by increasing the
  curvature.

** Minh
*** Things I like
There is a lot of replay value in your game idea.
*** Things I am unsure about
The low friction handicap may be a too little challenging in the beginning. 
It can also make it harder to instantly react to incoming obstacles.
*** Suggestions
In order to introduce the different obstacles and the way to deal with them,
a tutorial (perhaps optional) might help a lot of people starting with 
the game. 
Perhaps adding a different speed option when moving from side to side (e.g.
while holding shift) may help players adjust to different situations.

*** Things I like
- Really cool art design -- of course I don't know if the game will look like
  the art, but the art looks super cute
- The game design seems really fair and not relying on randomness to gain huge
  advantages

*** Things I am unsure about
- I think you have to be careful to not create frustrating moments through
  random events that are not recoverable

*** Suggestions
- I am having a hard time to write down suggestions for your project, mainly
  because I am now really knowledgeable about your game's genre. Just judging
  from what you want to archieve, I would maybe start with a super simple
  platform and first try to figure out, how complex the platform can be, before
  visibiliy and movement becomes an issue, especially because every player will
  look at the same screen. From there I would start to try to introduce the
  other mechanics and alwas keep an eye on the fairness and also possible
  visibiliy issues on the screen.

*** Things I like
- Really cool setting and theme.
- The ice golems are really cute.
- Number of map events seem appropriate and the mechanics look very fun.
- All aspects of the game, from the mechanics, game world and character design
  mesh very well together.
*** Things I am unsure about
- Will the single screen for all users affect the map size or character clarity
  in a negative way? (Because all players have to fit on the screen and there
  still needs to be enough space for the events, fighting, ect.)
*** Suggestions
- Implement split-screen functionality or online mode if the single screen
  inhibits gameplay due to map size.

** Minh
*** Things I like
I can see this game to be a fun multiplayer game with
a lot of replay value.
*** Things I am unsure about
I feel like for a party game there are a lot of skill
based mechanics. The amount of randomness in the form of the
destruction system also seems rather low and "easy" to deal
with. In the worst case your game may lose its identity as a party game.
This may lead to a division of players that mainly play "for fun" and
serious competitive players.
*** Suggestion
Maybe a comeback mechanic or a possibility to influence the game 
after losing may enhance the experience without changing your 
intended design direction too much.
