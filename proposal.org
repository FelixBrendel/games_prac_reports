* Game Description
# overview of game, overall gameplay
# include background or storyline associated with the game
# ~2-3 pages of text
# ~3 pages of mocked-up screenshots and/or sketches (pencil sketches are fine)
# highlight relation of theme (wet & slippery)
# justify every decision

Notes:
- {{{game_name}}} is a tile-based puzzle game
- in each level the player moves a cube from start tile to finish tile
- multiple floor-types:
  - slippery floor:
    - cube cannot change moving direction after button input until obstacle is hit
    - cube does not change the orientation of the cube
  - floors with grip:
    - on one button press cube moves only once
    - cube turns with each movement
- add mechanics every few levels -> steady learning curve:
  - cube is colored differently on every side
  - cube needs to be in a specific orientation on the finish tile
  - cube can be folded open:
    - bridge slippery tiles
    - multiple finish tiles one which all cube sides have to be in the end
  - player has to set tile types themselves
- so far no story or context, just fun puzzling for the sake of fun puzzling
  -> more freedom for ideas, not bound to setting or story
  -> bigger emphasis on simplicity

* Technical Achievement
# detail core technical item (1+)
As part of the development of {{{game_name}}} our group will develop our own
Game Engine. The game engine will use the Vulkan Graphics API to implement a
rendering pipeline. Vulkan is a new API developed by the Khronos Group
(maintainer of OpenGL) which allows us a very low level control of the GPU.


Notes:
- Vulkan
- procedural levels
- physically based rendering
- additional fancy shaders
- very minimalistic and pure, just like God's own Game Engine
- no c++ standard library
- no bloat allowed

* Development Schedule

*Layers of Development*:
1. Functional Minimum:
   - levels (including start and finish tiles)
   - movement of cube
   - slippery floor type
2. Low Target:
   - floors with grip
   - have sides differently colored
   - finish condition: cube must land on a specific side on the finish tile
3. Desirable Target:
   - cube can be folded open
   - multiple finish tiles
4. High Target:
   - have players set floors to floor types themselves
5. Extras:
   - ???

* Assessment
# main strength, target audience, world view for design, criteria for success

{{{game_name}}} is designed to be a cozy and fun puzzle game for people to enjoy
regardless of prior experiences of puzzle games or even video games in general.
To achieve that, the game will have to be easily accessible not requiring a lot
of prior knowledge. Later levels will add more and more mechanics effectively
raising the difficulty level which hopefully will keep players invested. The
difficulty curve in form of the levels provides one of the biggest challenges in
the development as a sudden difficulty spike can lead to a lot of frustration
while low curve may bore players.

Although we intend to provide players with healthy challenges along the levels, 
we generally want {{{game_name}}} to be a relaxing game to be played from time to time.

# Notes:
# - all about simplicity, no bombast
# - easy accessibility
# - just fun & cozy puzzle people can play from time to time
# - we hope for people to calm down when figuring out solutions for trickier levels
