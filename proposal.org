* Game Description
# overview of game, overall gameplay
# include background or storyline associated with the game
# ~2-3 pages of text
# ~3 pages of mocked-up screenshots and/or sketches (pencil sketches are fine)
# highlight relation of theme (wet & slippery)
# justify every decision

Notes:
- Hex is a tile-based puzzle game
- in each level the player moves a cube from start tile to finish tile
- multiple floor-types:
  - slippery floor:
	- cube cannot change moving direction after button input until obstacle is hit
	- cube does not change the orientation of the cube
  - floors with grip:
	- on one button press cube moves only once
	- cube turns with each movement
- add mechanics every few levels -> steady learning curve:
  - cube is colored differently on every side
  - cube needs to be in a specific orientation on the finish tile
  - cube can be folded open:
	- bridge slippery tiles
	- multiple finish tiles one which all cube sides have to be in the end
  - player has to set tile types themselves
- so far no story or context, just fun puzzling for the sake of fun puzzling
  -> more freedom for ideas, not bound to setting or story
  -> bigger emphasis on simplicity

* Technical Achievement
# detail core technical item (1+)

Notes:
- Vulkan
- procedural levels
- physically based rendering
- additional fancy shaders

* Development Schedule

\textbf{Layers of Development}:
1. Functional Minimum:
   - levels (including start and finish tiles)
   - movement of cube
   - slippery floor type
2. Low Target:
   - floors with grip
   - have sides differently colored
   - finish condition: cube must land on a specific side on the finish tile
3. Desirable Target:
   - cube can be folded open
   - multiple finish tiles
4. High Target:
   - have players set floors to floor types themselves
5. Extras:
   - ???

* Assessment
# main strength, target audience, world view for design, criteria for success

Notes:
- all about simplicity, no bombast
- easy accessibility
- just fun & cozy puzzle people can play from time to time
- we hope for people to calm down when figuring out solutions for trickier levels
